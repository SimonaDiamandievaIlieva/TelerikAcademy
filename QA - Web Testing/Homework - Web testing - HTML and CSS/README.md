Alpha 50 QA - Web Testing
HTML Group Project
Your task is to create a landing page(homepage) and a personal page using HTML & CSS (JavaScript is allowed, but not necessary). The topic will be of your choosing. Here are some examples: hobbies, sports, traditions and customs in different countries, professions, food and cooking, automobiles, tourist destinations, history and culture, etc. Let’s say you pick food and cooking. The landing page should explain all the basics of what your “website” will provide to the user. Each member of your team must also have a personal webpage where they showcase a part of the topic. E.g. your favorite dish and how to cook it. (preparation, ingredients, temperature and time, etc.) The landing page and personal pages must be within the same topic.
